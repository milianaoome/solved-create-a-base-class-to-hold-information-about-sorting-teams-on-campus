Create a base class to hold information about sorting teams on campus. If you are using visual studio to develop your solution, use the class library template. Design the base class so that it is not possible to instantiate the class. Include the characteristics you would find will all sports such as primary coaches name and the name of the sport. Define properties, a Tostring () method and a minimum of one virtual method that can be redefined for specific sports. The Tostring() method should return the name of the coach and the sport. Since no class is required to test tour base class, be sure to build the solution to ensure that no syntax error exist.
